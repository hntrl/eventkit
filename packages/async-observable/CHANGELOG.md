### Patch Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/hntrl/eventkit/pull/10) [`d1d5dca`](https://github.com/hntrl/eventkit/commit/d1d5dcace45730de1feabfbc81216a7fd034b29f) Thanks [@hntrl](https://github.com/hntrl)! - Gave some TLC to the bundling process for each package. Each package bundle now contains sourcemaps for both cjs & esm builds, as well as a new `index.global.js` and `index.global.min.js` that is intended to be used with browser targets.
