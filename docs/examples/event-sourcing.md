# Eventual Consistency

Eventkit is especially good at coordinating work in **ephemeral** contexts where strong **consistency guarantees** are required.

## What is Eventual Consistency?

Eventual consistency is a property of distributed systems where the system does not guarantee immediate consistency across all nodes. Instead, it allows for eventual consistency, where the system will converge to a consistent state over time.

## How Eventkit helps with Eventual Consistency

Eventkit provides a way to coordinate work in a way that is both flexible and consistent.
