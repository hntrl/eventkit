# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives us time to work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that the exploit will be used before a patch is released. Besides, make sure to align with us before any public disclosure to ensure no dangerous information goes public too soon.

Please disclose it at [security advisory](https://github.com/hntrl/eventkit/security/advisories/new).
